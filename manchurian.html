            2 tablespoons oil <br>
            1 tablespoon finely chopped ginger <br>

            1/2 cup finely chopped capsicum (bell pepper) <br>

            1 tablespoon soy sauce <br>
            1 tablespoon green chili sauce (adjust to your spice level) <br>
            1 tablespoon tomato ketchup <br>
            1/2 teaspoon vinegar <br>
            1/2 teaspoon sugar (optional, balances the flavors) <br>
            1 cup vegetable broth or water <br>
            1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons water (cornstarch slurry) <br>
            Salt to taste <br>
            Fresh spring onion greens for garnish <br><br>
            Instructions: <br>
            
            Making the Manchurian Balls: <br>
            
            Combine Vegetables: In a large bowl, combine the chopped cabbage, carrots, capsicum, spring onions, ginger, and garlic. <br>
            Add Dry Ingredients and Seasoning: Add all-purpose flour, cornstarch, soy sauce, black pepper powder, and salt to the vegetables. <br>
            Mix Well: Mix everything thoroughly with your hands. Start by just mixing the vegetables to release some moisture. Then, gradually bind the mixture. Add a little water (only if absolutely necessary) to form a firm, non-sticky dough. Be careful not to add too much water, as the balls will absorb too much oil while frying. <br>
            Shape into Balls: Take a small portion of the mixture and roll it between your palms to form small, smooth balls (about 1-inch in diameter). <br>
            Heat Oil: Heat oil in a deep frying pan or wok over medium heat. The oil should be hot enough for the balls to brown evenly. <br>
            Fry the Balls: Gently drop the prepared balls into the hot oil, a few at a time, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan. <br>
            Fry Until Golden Brown: Fry the balls on medium heat, turning them occasionally, until they are golden brown and cooked through (about 5-7 minutes). <br>
            Drain Excess Oil: Remove the fried balls with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. <br>
            Repeat: Repeat the process with the remaining mixture.
            Making the Manchurian Sauce (for Gravy): <br><br>
            
           Heat oil in a wok or pan over medium-high heat. Add chopped ginger, garlic, and white parts of spring onions. Sauté for about a minute until fragrant. <br>
            Sauté Onions and Capsicum: Add chopped onions and capsicum and sauté for another 2-3 minutes until the onions turn translucent. <br>
            Add Sauces: Add soy sauce, green chili sauce, and tomato ketchup. Mix well and cook for a minute. <br>
            Add Broth/Water and Seasoning: Pour in the vegetable broth or water. Add vinegar and sugar (if using). Bring the mixture to a simmer. Add salt to taste, keeping in mind that soy sauce is already salty. <br>
            Thicken the Sauce: Stir the cornstarch slurry (cornstarch mixed with water) well and gradually add it to the simmering sauce, stirring continuously to avoid lumps. Cook until the sauce thickens to your desired consistency. <br>
            Add Manchurian Balls: Gently add the fried Manchurian balls to the simmering sauce. Toss them gently to coat them evenly with the sauce. <br>
            Simmer: Let the Manchurian simmer in the sauce for 2-3 minutes, allowing the balls to absorb some of the flavors. <br>
            Garnish and Serve: Garnish with fresh spring onion greens and serve hot with fried rice, noodles, or as a standalone dish. <br>
            For Dry Manchurian: <br>
            
            Follow steps 1-8 for making the Manchurian balls. <br>
            In a separate pan or the same wok (after cleaning), follow steps 1-3 of making the sauce. <br>
            Add the fried Manchurian balls to the pan with the sautéed aromatics and sauces. <br>
            Toss well to coat the balls evenly with the sauces. <br>
            Sauté for another 1-2 minutes until the sauces have slightly coated and dried around the balls. <br>
            Garnish with fresh spring onion greens and serve hot as a snack or appetizer. <br>
            Enjoy your homemade Manchurian! Let me know if you have any other questions. <br>

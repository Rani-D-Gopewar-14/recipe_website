                    Motichur Laddu Recipe (Sweet Pearl Balls) <br>
Motichur Laddu is a popular Indian sweet made from tiny, deep-fried gram flour 
(besan) droplets called "boondi," which are then soaked in sugar syrup and shaped into soft, 
melt-in-your-mouth spheres. <br>

Ingredients
For the Boondi: <br>

1 cup besan (gram flour/chickpea flour) <br>
¼ teaspoon orange food coloring (optional, for traditional color) <br>
Water, as needed<br>
Ghee or oil, for deep frying <br>
For the Sugar Syrup: <br>

1 cup sugar <br>
½ cup water <br>
¼ teaspoon cardamom powder <br>
A few strands of saffron (kesar) (optional) <br>
¼ teaspoon lemon juice (helps prevent crystallization) <br>
For the Laddus: <br>

2 tablespoons chopped nuts (almonds, pistachios, cashews - optional) <br>
1 tablespoon melon seeds (magaz) (optional) <br>
Instructions <br>
1. Prepare the Boondi Batter: <br>

In a mixing bowl, whisk together the besan and food coloring (if using). <br>
Gradually add water, a little at a time, while whisking continuously to form a smooth, lump-free batter. The consistency should be thin, flowing, and similar to a thin dosa batter. It should not be too thick or too watery.
Let the batter rest for about 15-20 minutes. <br> <br>
2. Prepare the Sugar Syrup: <br>

In a saucepan, combine the sugar and water. 
Place the saucepan over medium heat and stir until the sugar dissolves completely.  <br>

Bring the syrup to a boil and then reduce the heat to low.
Simmer the syrup until it reaches a one-string consistency. To check this, take a drop of syrup between your thumb and index finger. When you pull them apart, a single thin thread should form.
Add cardamom powder and saffron strands (if using) to the syrup. Stir well.
Add lemon juice and mix. Turn off the heat and keep the syrup warm.  <br><br>
3. Fry the Boondi: <br>

Heat ghee or oil in a deep frying pan or kadhai over medium heat. The oil should be hot but not smoking.
Hold a slotted spoon with medium-sized holes (a boondi jhara) about 2-3 inches above the hot oil.
Pour a ladleful of the besan batter onto the boondi jhara and gently tap it with another spoon or ladle. Small droplets of batter will fall into the hot oil.
Fry the boondi on medium heat until they are light golden and cooked through (about 1-2 minutes). Do not over-fry them, as they should remain soft.
Remove the fried boondi with a slotted spoon and drain the excess oil on a paper towel-lined plate.
Repeat the process with the remaining batter, cleaning the boondi jhara as needed to prevent clogging. <br><br>
4. Soak the Boondi in Sugar Syrup: <br>

Once all the boondi is fried, transfer them to the warm sugar syrup.
Gently stir the boondi to ensure they are fully coated with the syrup.
Let the boondi soak in the syrup for at least 30-45 minutes, or until they have absorbed most of the syrup and become soft. <br>
5. Shape the Laddus: <br>

After the boondi has soaked well, add the chopped nuts and melon seeds (if using) to the mixture. Mix gently.
Take a small portion of the boondi mixture in your palm and gently shape it into a round laddu by pressing and rolling it between your palms. The mixture should be moist enough to bind easily. If it's too dry, you can add a tablespoon or two of warm sugar syrup.
Place the shaped laddu on a plate.
Repeat the process with the remaining boondi mixture until all the laddus are formed. <br><br>
6. Set and Serve: <br>

Allow the laddus to set for a few hours at room temperature so that they firm up slightly.
Motichur Laddus are best enjoyed at room temperature. You can store them in an airtight container for several days.
Enjoy these delicious and melt-in-your-mouth Motichur Laddus! They are a perfect treat for festivals and celebrations. <br>

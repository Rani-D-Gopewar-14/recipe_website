            Chhole (Chickpea Curry) <br>

This is a flavorful and popular North Indian dish made with chickpeas in a spicy and tangy tomato-based gravy. <br>

Ingredients: <br>

For Soaking & Boiling Chickpeas: <br>

1 cup dried chickpeas (kabuli chana) <br>
4 cups water (for soaking) <br>
2 cups water (for boiling, or as needed) <br>
1 black tea bag (optional, for color and flavor) <br>
1/2 teaspoon baking soda (optional, helps in softening) <br>
For the Curry: <br>

2 tablespoons cooking oil (such as vegetable, mustard, or ghee) <br>
1 teaspoon cumin seeds <br>
1 inch cinnamon stick <br>
2-3 green cardamom pods <br>
3-4 cloves <br>
1 bay leaf <br>
1 large onion, finely chopped <br>
1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste <br>
1-2 green chilies, slit (adjust to your spice preference) <br>
2 medium tomatoes, finely chopped or pureed <br>
1 teaspoon coriander powder <br>
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder <br>
1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to your spice preference) <br>
1/2 teaspoon1 cumin powder    <br>

1/4 teaspoon asafoetida (hing) <br>
1 teaspoon garam masala <br>
1/2 teaspoon dried mango powder (amchur) (optional, for tanginess) <br>
Salt to taste
Fresh coriander leaves, chopped, for garnish <br> <br>
Instructions: <br>

Soak the Chickpeas: Rinse the dried chickpeas thoroughly under cold water. Place them in a large bowl and add 4 cups of fresh water. Soak them overnight or for at least 8 hours. <br>
Boil the Chickpeas: Drain the soaked chickpeas and rinse them again. Transfer them to a pressure cooker or a large pot. Add 2 cups of fresh water (or enough to cover the chickpeas by about an inch). If using, add the black tea bag and baking soda. <br><br>
Pressure Cook (if using): Close the lid of the pressure cooker and cook on medium heat for 4-5 whistles, or until the chickpeas are very tender. Let the pressure release naturally. Open the cooker and discard the tea bag. <br><br>
Boil in a Pot (if not using pressure cooker): Bring the chickpeas to a boil in the pot, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1-1.5 hours, or until the chickpeas are very tender. You may need to add more water during cooking if it evaporates too much. Discard the tea bag if used. <br><br>
Prepare the Base: While the chickpeas are cooking, heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed pan or pot over medium heat.
Temper the Spices: Once the oil is hot, add cumin seeds. Let them splutter. Then add cinnamon stick, green cardamom pods, cloves, and bay leaf. Sauté for a few seconds until fragrant. <br><br>
Sauté Onions: Add the finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown. This might take 8-10 minutes, so be patient. <br>
Add Ginger-Garlic and Green Chilies: Stir in the ginger-garlic paste and slit green chilies. Sauté for another minute until the raw smell disappears. <br>
Cook Tomatoes: Add the finely chopped or pureed tomatoes. Cook until the tomatoes are softened and the oil starts to separate from the sides. This usually takes about 5-7 minutes. <br>
Add Dry Spices: Lower the heat and add coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, cumin powder, and asafoetida. Sauté for a minute, stirring continuously, to avoid burning the spices. You can add a tablespoon of water if the mixture seems too dry. <br><br>
Combine Chickpeas with Gravy: Once the chickpeas are cooked, lightly mash a few of them with the back of a spoon. This helps to thicken the gravy. Add the boiled chickpeas along with the cooking liquid to the pan with the tomato-onion mixture. <br><br>
Simmer: Bring the curry to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for another 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. <br>
Add Finishing Touches: Stir in the garam masala and dried mango powder (if using). Taste and adjust the salt as needed. <br>
Garnish and Serve: Garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves. Serve hot with naan, roti, paratha, rice, or bhatura. <br><br>
Enjoy your delicious homemade Chhole! <br>

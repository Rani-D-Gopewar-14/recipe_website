                    Dosa Recipe (South Indian Crepes) <br>
Dosa is a popular South Indian crepe made from a fermented batter of rice and lentils. 
It's naturally gluten-free, crispy, and versatile, often served with sambar and various chutneys. 
Here's a recipe for making delicious homemade dosas. <br><br>


Ingredients <br>
2 cups raw rice (dosa rice or regular short-grain rice) <br>
Â½ cup urad dal (split black lentils, skinless) <br>
1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (methi seeds) <br>
Salt to taste <br>
Water, as needed <br>
Oil or ghee, for cooking the dosas <br> <br>
Instructions <br>
1. Prepare the Batter (Soaking): <br>

Rinse the rice and urad dal together thoroughly under running water 2-3 times.
Add the fenugreek seeds to the rice and dal mixture.
Soak them in separate bowls with enough water (about 2-3 inches above the grains) for at least 4-6 hours,
 or preferably overnight. Soaking them separately helps in even grinding. <br><br>
2. Grind the Urad Dal: <br>

Drain all the water from the soaked urad dal.
Grind the urad dal in a blender or wet grinder with just enough water to form a very
 smooth and fluffy batter. The batter should be light and airy. <br><br>
3. Grind the Rice:<br>

Drain all the water from the soaked rice and fenugreek seeds.
Grind the rice in the same blender or wet grinder with just enough water to form a smooth but slightly grainy batter. It should not be as fine as the urad dal batter. <br><br>
4. Mix and Ferment the Batter: <br>

Pour the ground urad dal batter and rice batter into a large, clean, non-reactive bowl.
Add salt to taste to the combined batter.
Mix both batters very well with your hand (using your hand helps in good fermentation due to the natural warmth) or a spatula until they are thoroughly combined and the consistency is uniform. The batter should be thick but easily pourable.
Cover the bowl tightly and place it in a warm place to ferment for at least 8-12 hours, 
or until the batter has risen and has a slightly sour aroma.
 The fermentation time will vary depending on the temperature of your environment.
  Given the current time (early May) and location (India), a warm spot in your kitchen should work well. <br><br>
5. Prepare for Cooking: <br>

Once the batter has fermented, gently stir it without deflating too much of the air.
 The consistency should be thin enough to spread easily on a hot griddle.
  If it's too thick, add a little water to adjust. <br><br>
6. Cook the Dosas: <br>

Heat a flat non-stick griddle or tawa (cast iron tawa works best for crispy dosas) over medium-high heat. The tawa should be hot but not smoking.
Lightly grease the tawa with a few drops of oil.
Take a ladleful of the batter and pour it in the center of the hot tawa.
Using the bottom of the ladle, gently spread the batter in a circular motion, starting from the center and moving outwards to form a thin crepe. Aim for an even thickness.
Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges and on the surface of the dosa.
Cook on medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or until the bottom turns golden brown and crispy.
You can either serve the dosa plain (sada dosa) or flip it over and cook for another 30 seconds to a minute until the other side is lightly golden.
For a masala dosa, place a spoonful of potato masala filling in the center of the dosa before folding it in half or into a roll.
Repeat the process with the remaining batter, greasing the tawa lightly before making each dosa. <br><br>
7. Serve: <br>

Serve the hot and crispy dosas immediately with sambar, coconut chutney, tomato chutney, or any other chutney of your choice.
Enjoy your delicious homemade Dosas!

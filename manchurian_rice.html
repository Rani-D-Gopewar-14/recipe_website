            1/2 teaspoon sugar (optional, adjust to taste) <br>
            1 teaspoon cornflour mixed with 2 tablespoons of water (cornflour slurry) <br>
            Salt to taste <br>
            Water as needed <br>
            For the Fried Rice: <br>
            
            2 cups cooked and cooled basmati rice (preferably day-old rice)<br>
            2 tablespoons oil<br>
            1/2 cup finely chopped mixed vegetables (carrots, beans, peas, capsicum)<br>
            1 tablespoon finely chopped spring onions (greens only)<br>
            1 teaspoon soy sauce<br>
            1/2 teaspoon black pepper powder<br>
            Salt to taste (adjust carefully, as Manchurian sauce also has salt)<br><br>
            Instructions:<br>
            
            1. Prepare the Vegetable Manchurian Balls:<br>
            
            In a large bowl, combine the chopped cabbage, carrots, capsicum, spring onions, ginger, and garlic.
            Add all-purpose flour, cornflour, soy sauce, black pepper powder, and salt. Mix well with your hands. If the mixture feels too dry, you can add a tablespoon of water, but be careful not to make it too wet. The vegetables should release enough moisture.
            Shape the mixture into small, round balls (about 1 inch in diameter).
            Heat oil in a deep frying pan or wok over medium heat.
            Carefully drop the Manchurian balls into the hot oil, a few at a time.
            Fry them on medium-low heat until they are golden brown and crispy.
            Remove the fried balls with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.<br><br>
            2. Make the Manchurian Sauce:<br>
            
            Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a wok or a large pan over medium-high heat.
            Add the chopped garlic and ginger and sauté for a few seconds until fragrant. Be careful not to burn them.
            Add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent.
            Add the chopped capsicum and spring onion whites and sauté for another minute until slightly softened.
            Pour in the soy sauce, green chili sauce, tomato ketchup, and vinegar. Stir well.
            Add sugar (if using) and salt to taste. Remember that the soy sauce already contains salt.
            Add about 1/2 cup of water and bring the sauce to a simmer.
            Stir the cornflour slurry and pour it into the simmering sauce. Cook, stirring continuously, until the sauce thickens to your desired consistency. You can add more water if the sauce becomes too thick.
            Add the fried vegetable Manchurian balls to the sauce and toss gently to coat them well. Cook for another 1-2 minutes, allowing the balls to soak up the sauce.
            Garnish with the green parts of the spring onions.<br><br>
            3. Prepare the Fried Rice:<br>
            
            Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a separate wok or large pan over high heat.
            Add the finely chopped mixed vegetables (carrots, beans, peas, capsicum) and sauté for 2-3 minutes until they are slightly tender-crisp.
            Add the cooked and cooled rice to the wok. Break up any clumps of rice with a spatula.
            Add soy sauce and black pepper powder. Toss and mix well, ensuring the sauce and pepper are evenly distributed.
            Add salt to taste, keeping in mind that the Manchurian sauce is also seasoned. Taste and adjust accordingly.
            Stir in the chopped spring onion greens.<br><br>
            4. Combine and Serve:<br>
            
            There are two ways to serve Manchurian Rice:<br>
            
            Option 1 (Mixed): Add the prepared vegetable Manchurian (with the sauce) to the fried rice in the wok. Gently mix everything together until the rice is well coated with the Manchurian sauce and the Manchurian balls are evenly distributed.
            Option 2 (Separate): Serve the fried rice in a bowl and top it with a generous portion of the vegetable Manchurian and its gravy.
            Serve hot and enjoy!

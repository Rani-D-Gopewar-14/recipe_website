        Chicken Biryani Recipe <br>


Ingredients <br>
For Marinating the Chicken: <br>

500g chicken pieces (thighs and drumsticks work well), with bone-in or boneless<br>
1 cup yogurt (dahi) <br>
2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste <br>
1 tablespoon biryani masala powder (store-bought or homemade) <br>
1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to your spice preference) <br>
½ teaspoon turmeric powder <br>
½ teaspoon garam masala <br>
Juice of ½ lemon  <br>

2 tablespoons chopped mint leaves (pudina) <br>
2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves (dhania) <br>
Salt to taste <br>
For the Rice: <br>

2 cups basmati rice <br>
4 cups water <br>
1 bay leaf
2-3 green cardamom pods <br>
3-4 cloves <br>
1-inch cinnamon stick <br>
1 teaspoon shahi jeera (caraway seeds) <br>
1 tablespoon oil or ghee <br>
Salt to taste <br>
For Layering and Garnish: <br>

2 large onions, thinly sliced <br>
¼ cup oil or ghee, for frying onions <br>
¼ cup milk <br>
A few strands of saffron <br>
2 tablespoons chopped mint leaves <br>
2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves <br>
2-3 green chilies, slit (optional) <br>
Fried cashews and raisins (optional) <br>
Instructions <br><br>
1. Marinate the Chicken:<br>

In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces, yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, biryani masala powder, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, lemon juice, mint leaves, coriander leaves, and salt.
Mix well to ensure the chicken is evenly coated with the marinade.
Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or preferably for 2-3 hours (or even overnight for deeper flavor). <br><br>
2. Prepare the Rice: <br>

Wash the basmati rice thoroughly under cold running water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch.
Soak the rice in enough water for 20-30 minutes. Drain well before using.
In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the bay leaf, cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, shahi jeera, oil or ghee, and salt.
Add the soaked and drained rice to the boiling water. Stir gently once.
Cook the rice on medium heat until it is about 70-80% cooked. The grains should still have a slight bite to them. This usually takes about 7-10 minutes.
Drain the partially cooked rice in a colander and set aside. <br><br>
3. Fry the Onions: <br>

Heat oil or ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan or skillet over medium heat.
Add the thinly sliced onions and fry them until they are golden brown and crispy. This is called "birista".
Remove about half of the fried onions and set them aside for garnish. Keep the remaining fried onions in the pan. <br><br>
4. Layer the Biryani and Cook: <br>

To the pan with the remaining fried onions, add the marinated chicken. Spread it evenly at the bottom of the pan.
Layer the partially cooked rice evenly over the chicken.
In a small bowl, soak the saffron strands in warm milk.
Sprinkle the saffron milk, chopped mint leaves, chopped coriander leaves, and slit green chilies (if using) over the rice.
Scatter the reserved fried onions and fried cashews and raisins (if using) on top.
Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid. You can also seal the edges of the lid with aluminum foil to trap the steam inside (this process is called "dum").
Cook the biryani on low heat for 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the chicken to cook completely.
Turn off the heat and let the biryani rest for another 10-15 minutes with the lid still on. This allows the rice to absorb any remaining moisture and become perfectly fluffy. <br><br>
5. Serve: <br>

Gently fluff the biryani with a fork before serving. Be careful not to mash the rice grains.
Serve hot with raita (yogurt dip), salan (a spicy gravy), or a simple salad.
Enjoy your aromatic and delicious Chicken Biryani! You can adjust the spices and ingredients according to your taste. 
There are many exciting variations of biryani to explore, such as vegetable biryani, mutton biryani, and fish biryani, each offering a unique culinary experience. <br><br>

                    Puran Poli Recipe (Sweet Flatbread Stuffed with Lentils and Jaggery) <br>
Puran Poli is a traditional Maharashtrian sweet flatbread, often made during festivals 
like Holi and Ganesh Chaturthi. It consists of a sweet lentil and jaggery filling (Puran)
 encased in a soft dough (Poli). <br>



Ingredients
For the Puran (Sweet Filling): <br>

1 cup chana dal (split chickpeas) <br>
2 cups water (for soaking) + more for cooking <br>
¾ - 1 cup grated jaggery (adjust to your sweetness preference) <br>
½ teaspoon cardamom powder <br>
¼ teaspoon nutmeg powder (optional) <br>
For the Poli (Outer Dough): <br>

2 cups all-purpose flour (maida) <br>
¼ teaspoon turmeric powder <br>
2-3 tablespoons oil <br>
Water, as needed <br>
Extra flour for rolling <br>
Ghee or oil, for cooking <br>
Instructions <br>
1. Prepare the Puran (Sweet Filling): <br>

Soak the Chana Dal: Wash the chana dal thoroughly under running water. Soak it in 2 cups of water for at least 2-3 hours.
Cook the Chana Dal: Drain the soaked chana dal and transfer it to a pressure cooker or a regular pot. Add enough fresh water to cover the dal (about 1-1.5 cups).
Pressure Cooker: Cook for 3-4 whistles on medium heat, or until the dal is cooked and very soft.
Pot Cooking: Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until the dal is very soft and easily mashable (about 20-25 minutes). Drain any excess water completely.
Mash the Dal: Once the dal is cooked and drained, mash it well using a potato masher or the back of a spoon. Ensure there are no lumps.
Cook with Jaggery: In a heavy-bottomed pan or kadhai, combine the mashed dal and grated jaggery. Cook on medium heat, stirring continuously, until the jaggery melts and the mixture thickens. This will take about 10-15 minutes. Keep stirring to prevent sticking.
Add Flavorings: Once the mixture becomes thick and starts leaving the sides of the pan, add cardamom powder and nutmeg powder (if using). Mix well.
Cool the Puran: Transfer the puran mixture to a plate and let it cool completely. As it cools, it will solidify further and become easier to handle. <br><br>
2. Prepare the Poli (Outer Dough): <br>

In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and turmeric powder.
Add 2-3 tablespoons of oil and mix it well with the flour using your fingertips until the flour resembles breadcrumbs. This step makes the poli soft.
Gradually add water, a little at a time, and knead to form a smooth, soft, and pliable dough. The dough should be similar in consistency to chapati dough, but slightly softer.
Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. This allows the gluten to relax, making the poli easier to roll. <br><br>
3. Make the Puran Polis: <br>

Divide the rested dough into small, equal-sized balls (about the size of a small lemon).
Divide the cooled puran mixture into equal-sized balls, slightly smaller than the dough balls.
Take one dough ball and flatten it slightly with your palms.
Place a puran ball in the center of the flattened dough.
Gently bring the edges of the dough together to cover the puran completely, sealing it well. Remove any excess dough if necessary.
Dust a rolling surface and rolling pin with some flour.
Gently roll the stuffed dough ball into a thin, circular flatbread (poli) of about 4-5 inches in diameter. Be careful not to apply too much pressure, as the puran might come out. If it sticks, dust with more flour. <br>
4. Cook the Puran Polis: <br>

Heat a flat griddle or tawa over medium heat.
Carefully place the rolled puran poli on the hot griddle.
Cook for a minute or two on each side, until light golden spots appear.
Apply a little ghee or oil on both sides of the poli and cook again, pressing gently with a spatula, until both sides are golden brown and slightly puffed up. <br>
5. Serve: <br>

Remove the cooked puran poli from the griddle and transfer it to a plate.
Serve hot or warm, drizzled with more ghee. Puran Polis are traditionally enjoyed with a side of katachi amti (tangy lentil soup) or just plain with ghee.
Enjoy these delicious and sweet Puran Polis!

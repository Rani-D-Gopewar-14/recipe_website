    Appe (Savory Pancakes) Recipe <br>
Appe, also known as Paddu, Paniyaram, or Guntaponganalu, are delicious and 
healthy South Indian savory pancakes made from a fermented batter of rice and lentils. 
They are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. <br>

Ingredients <br>
For the Batter: <br>

1 cup raw rice (idli rice or regular short-grain rice) <br>
¼ cup urad dal (split black lentils, skinless) <br>
¼ teaspoon fenugreek seeds (methi seeds) <br>
Salt to taste <br>
Water, as needed <br>
For the Tempering and Vegetables: <br>

1 tablespoon oil <br>
½ teaspoon mustard seeds <br>
½ teaspoon urad dal (split black lentils, skinless) <br>
A pinch of asafoetida (hing) <br>
1 small onion, finely chopped <br>
1-2 green chilies, finely chopped (adjust to your spice preference) <br>
½ inch ginger, grated <br>
¼ cup finely chopped vegetables (carrots, capsicum, peas - optional) <br>
2 tablespoons finely chopped coriander leaves <br> <br>
Instructions <br>
1. Prepare the Batter (Soaking): <br>

Rinse the raw rice and urad dal together thoroughly under running water 2-3 times.
Add the fenugreek seeds to the rice and dal mixture.
Soak them in enough water (about 2-3 inches above the grains) for at least 4-6 hours, or preferably overnight. <br><br>
2. Grind the Batter: <br>]

Drain all the water from the soaked rice, dal, and fenugreek seeds.
Grind them in a blender or wet grinder with just enough water to form a smooth, thick batter. The consistency should be similar to dosa or idli batter – easily pourable but not too runny.
Add salt to taste to the batter. <br><br>
3. Ferment the Batter: <br>

Pour the batter into a clean, non-reactive bowl.
Cover the bowl tightly and place it in a warm place to ferment for at least 8-12 hours, or until the batter has doubled in volume. The fermentation time will vary depending on the temperature of your environment (it takes longer in colder weather). Given the current time and location (India, early May), a warm spot in your kitchen should work well.
Once fermented, the batter will have a slightly sour aroma and a bubbly texture. <br><br>
4. Prepare the Tempering and Vegetables:<br>

Heat oil in a small pan or tadka ladle over medium heat.
Add mustard seeds and let them splutter.
Add urad dal and sauté until it turns light golden brown.
Add asafoetida (hing) and sauté for a few seconds.
Add the finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent.
Add the finely chopped green chilies and grated ginger. Sauté for another minute.
If using, add the finely chopped vegetables (carrots, capsicum, peas) and sauté for 2-3 minutes until they are slightly cooked.
Turn off the heat and add the finely chopped coriander leaves to the tempering. <br><br>
5. Mix the Tempering with the Batter:<br>

Gently fold the prepared tempering into the fermented batter. Mix well. <br>
6. Cook the Appe:<br>

Heat an appe pan (also known as paniyaram pan or aebleskiver pan) over medium heat.
Grease each cavity of the appe pan with a few drops of oil.
Once the pan is hot, pour the batter into each cavity, filling it almost to the top but leaving a little space for it to rise.
Cover the pan with a lid and cook on medium-low heat for 2-3 minutes, or until the bottom side turns golden brown.
Using a spoon or a skewer, carefully flip each appe to the other side.
Cover the pan again and cook for another 2-3 minutes, or until the other side is also golden brown and the appe are cooked through.
Repeat the process with the remaining batter, greasing the cavities as needed. <br><br>
7. Serve: <br>

Transfer the cooked appe to a serving plate.
Serve hot with sambar, coconut chutney, tomato chutney, or any other chutney of your choice.
Enjoy these delicious and healthy Appe!

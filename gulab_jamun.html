                    Gulab Jamun Recipe (Milk Solid Sweet Balls) <br>
Gulab Jamun are soft, spongy, and melt-in-your-mouth milk-based balls 
soaked in a fragrant sugar syrup. They are a classic and beloved Indian sweet,
 perfect for celebrations or any time you crave something truly delicious. <br>


Ingredients
For the Gulab Jamuns: <br>

1 cup milk powder (full-fat milk powder is recommended for best results)<br>
¼ cup all-purpose flour (maida)<br>
¼ teaspoon baking soda<br>
2 tablespoons unsalted butter or ghee, softened<br>
2-3 tablespoons milk, at room temperature (or as needed to form a dough) <br>
Oil or ghee, for deep frying <br>
For the Sugar Syrup (Chashni): <br>

2 cups sugar <br>
1 ½ cups water <br>
½ teaspoon cardamom powder <br>
A few strands of saffron (kesar) (optional) <br>
½ teaspoon rose water (optional) <br>
½ teaspoon lemon juice (helps prevent crystallization) <br>
Instructions <br>
1. Prepare the Sugar Syrup (Chashni): <br>

In a deep saucepan or pot, combine sugar and water.
Place the pan over medium heat and stir until the sugar dissolves completely.
Bring the syrup to a boil and then reduce the heat to low.
Simmer for about 8-10 minutes, or until the syrup becomes slightly sticky (about one-string consistency – when a drop of syrup is taken between your thumb and index finger and pulled apart, it should form a single thin thread).
Add cardamom powder, saffron strands (if using), and rose water (if using). Stir well.
Add lemon juice and mix. This helps prevent the syrup from crystallizing.
Keep the syrup warm over very low heat while you prepare the gulab jamuns. <br><br>
2. Prepare the Gulab Jamun Dough: <br><br>

In a large bowl, mix together the milk powder, all-purpose flour, and baking soda.
Add the softened butter or ghee to the dry ingredients and mix well with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Gradually add milk, one tablespoon at a time, and mix gently to form a soft, smooth, and pliable dough. Do not knead the dough too much, just bring it together. The dough should be slightly sticky but manageable.
Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 5-10 minutes. This allows the semolina in the milk powder to absorb moisture. <br>
3. Shape the Gulab Jamuns: <br>

Lightly grease your palms with oil or ghee.
Take a small portion of the dough (about the size of a small marble or a little larger).
Gently roll it between your palms to form a smooth, crack-free ball. Cracks in the balls can cause them to break while frying.
Shape all the remaining dough into smooth balls and keep them covered with a damp cloth to prevent them from drying out. <br><br>
4. Deep Fry the Gulab Jamuns: <br>

Heat oil or ghee in a deep frying pan or kadhai over low to medium-low heat. The oil should not be too hot, otherwise, the jamuns will cook quickly from the outside but remain raw inside.
Gently slide a few gulab jamuns at a time into the hot oil. Do not overcrowd the pan.
Fry them on low to medium-low heat, stirring or gently swirling them continuously, until they turn a rich golden brown color all over. This process should take about 8-10 minutes. Ensure they cook evenly from the inside.
Once they are golden brown, remove them carefully with a slotted spoon and immediately transfer them to the warm sugar syrup. <br><br>
5. Soak the Gulab Jamuns: <br>

Make sure the sugar syrup is warm. The warmth helps the jamuns absorb the syrup better.
Gently press the gulab jamuns down in the syrup so they are fully immersed.
Cover the pan and let the gulab jamuns soak in the warm syrup for at least 1-2 hours, or preferably longer (3-4 hours), so they can absorb the syrup and become soft and spongy. <br><br>
6. Serve: <br>

Gulab Jamuns can be served warm or at room temperature.
Garnish with chopped nuts (almonds, pistachios) or a drizzle of extra syrup if desired.
Enjoy these delightful and irresistible Gulab Jamuns! They are best served fresh but can be stored in the refrigerator for a few days. Warm them slightly before serving if refrigerated.

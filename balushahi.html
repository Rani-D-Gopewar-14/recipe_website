                    Balushahi Recipe (Indian Doughnut) <br>
Balushahi is a traditional North Indian sweet, similar to a glazed doughnut but with a 
flaky, layered texture inside and a sugary, syrupy coating outside. Here's a detailed recipe 
to make this delectable treat at home. <br>



Ingredients 
For the Dough: <br>

2 cups all-purpose flour (maida) <br>
¼ teaspoon baking soda <br>
½ teaspoon baking powder <br>
¼ cup ghee (clarified butter), melted <br>
¼ cup plain yogurt (dahi), at room temperature <br>
2-3 tablespoons cold water, or as needed <br>
Oil or ghee, for deep frying
For the Sugar Syrup (Chashni): <br>

1 ½ cups sugar <br>
¾ cup water <br>
½ teaspoon cardamom powder <br>
1 teaspoon lemon juice <br>
A few strands of saffron (kesar) (optional) <br><br>
Instructions <br>
1. Prepare the Sugar Syrup (Chashni): <br>

In a saucepan, combine sugar and water.
Place the saucepan over medium heat and stir until the sugar dissolves completely.
Bring the syrup to a boil and then reduce the heat to low.
Simmer for about 5-7 minutes, or until the syrup reaches a one-string consistency. To check, take a drop of syrup between your thumb and forefinger and gently pull them apart. A single thin thread should form.
Add cardamom powder, lemon juice, and saffron strands (if using). 
Stir well and turn off the heat. Keep the syrup warm. 
The lemon juice prevents the syrup from crystallizing. <br><br>
2. Prepare the Dough: <br>

In a large mixing bowl, sift together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and baking powder.
Add the melted ghee to the flour mixture and mix well with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. This step is crucial for the flaky texture.
Add the room temperature yogurt to the flour mixture and mix gently.
Gradually add cold water, a tablespoon at a time, and mix until you form a soft, non-sticky dough. Do not knead the dough vigorously. Just bring it together.
Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.
 This resting time allows the gluten to relax, resulting in a flaky texture. <br>
3. Shape the Balushahis: <br>

After the dough has rested, gently knead it once or twice.
Divide the dough into small, equal-sized balls (about 1.5-2 inches in diameter).
Take one dough ball and flatten it slightly between your palms.
Using your thumb, make a small indentation in the center of the flattened dough. This helps in even cooking from the inside.
Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls. <br><br>
4. Deep Fry the Balushahis: <br>
 
Heat oil or ghee in a deep frying pan or kadhai over low to medium heat. The oil should not be too hot, as this will cook the outside quickly and leave the inside raw.
Gently slide a few balushahis at a time into the warm oil. Do not overcrowd the pan.
Fry the balushahis on low to medium heat, stirring occasionally, until they turn golden brown and are cooked through. This process will take about 10-12 minutes per batch. The low heat ensures that the inside cooks properly and the outside becomes crispy.
Once golden brown, carefully remove the balushahis with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil. <br><br>
5. Soak in Sugar Syrup: <br>

While the balushahis are still warm (not too hot, not completely cooled), gently drop them into the warm sugar syrup.
Let them soak in the syrup for at least 15-20 minutes, turning them over occasionally to ensure they are evenly coated and absorb the syrup well. <br><br>
6. Serve: <br>

After soaking, carefully remove the balushahis from the sugar syrup and arrange them on a serving plate.
You can garnish them with chopped pistachios or almonds, if desired.
Serve the balushahis warm or at room temperature. They can be stored in an airtight container for a few days.
Enjoy these delicious and flaky Balushahis! They are perfect for festive occasions or as a sweet treat.

                Dhokla Recipe (Steamed Savory Cake) <br>
Dhokla is a light, fluffy, and slightly tangy steamed cake 
originating from the Indian state of Gujarat. 
It's a popular snack and breakfast dish. This recipe provides instructions for
 making Khaman Dhokla, the most common and well-loved variety. <br>



Ingredients 
For the Dhokla Batter: <br>

1 cup besan (gram flour/chickpea flour)<br>
1 tablespoon sooji (semolina/rava) <br>
1 teaspoon ginger-green chili paste <br>
1 teaspoon sugar <br>
½ teaspoon turmeric powder <br>
¼ teaspoon asafoetida (hing) <br>
1 teaspoon lemon juice <br>
1 teaspoon oil <br>
Salt to taste <br>
¾ cup water<br>
1 teaspoon eno fruit salt (baking soda can be used as a substitute,
 but eno gives a better texture) <br><br>
For the Tempering (Tadka): <br>

2 tablespoons oil <br>
1 teaspoon mustard seeds <br>
1 teaspoon sesame seeds <br>
2-3 green chilies, slit lengthwise <br>
8-10 curry leaves <br>
½ cup water <br>
1 tablespoon sugar <br>
1 tablespoon lemon juice <br>
2 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander leaves, for garnish <br> <br>
Instructions <br>
1. Prepare the Batter: <br>

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the besan and sooji. This helps to prevent lumps.
Add ginger-green chili paste, sugar, turmeric powder, asafoetida (hing), lemon juice, oil, and salt to the besan mixture.
Gradually add water while whisking continuously to form a smooth, lump-free batter. The consistency should be medium-thick, like a thick pancake batter.
Cover the bowl and let the batter rest for at least 15-20 minutes. This allows the sooji to absorb the moisture and the flavors to meld. <br><br>
2. Prepare the Steamer: <br>

While the batter is resting, prepare your steamer. You can use a regular steamer or a large pot with a tight-fitting lid.
Add about 2-3 cups of water to the steamer and bring it to a boil.
Grease a shallow dish or pan (about 6-7 inches in diameter) with oil. This will be used to steam the dhokla. <br><br>
3. Add Eno Fruit Salt: <br>

Just before you are ready to steam the dhokla, add the eno fruit salt to the batter.
Immediately whisk the batter vigorously for about a minute. You will notice the batter becoming light and frothy. This step needs to be done quickly, and the batter should be steamed immediately after adding eno. <br><br>
4. Steam the Dhokla: <br>

Pour the frothy batter into the greased dish or pan.
Gently tap the dish a couple of times to release any air bubbles.
Carefully place the dish into the preheated steamer.
Cover the steamer tightly and steam on medium heat for 15-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. <br><br>
5. Prepare the Tempering (Tadka): <br>

While the dhokla is steaming, prepare the tempering.
Heat oil in a small pan or tadka ladle over medium heat.
Add mustard seeds and let them splutter.
Add sesame seeds and let them crackle.
Add the slit green chilies and curry leaves. Sauté for a few seconds until the curry leaves are fragrant.
Add water, sugar, and lemon juice to the pan. Bring it to a boil and then simmer for a minute until the sugar dissolves. <br><br>
6. Cool and Cut the Dhokla: <br>

Once the dhokla is cooked, remove the dish from the steamer and let it cool slightly for about 5-10 minutes.
Cut the dhokla into square or diamond-shaped pieces. <br><br>
7. Pour the Tempering: <br>

Spoon the prepared tempering evenly over the cut dhokla pieces. Make sure the liquid is absorbed well. <br><br>
8. Garnish and Serve: <br>

Garnish the dhokla with freshly chopped coriander leaves.
Serve the dhokla warm with green chutney, tamarind chutney, or on its own.
Enjoy your light and spongy Khaman Dhokla!

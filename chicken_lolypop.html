        Chicken Lollipop Recipe <br>
This recipe will guide you to make crispy and flavorful chicken lollipops, a popular Indo-Chinese appetizer. <br>



Ingredients <br><br>
For the Chicken: <br>

500g chicken wings (drumettes and wingettes separated) <br>
1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste <br>
1 teaspoon soy sauce <br>
1 teaspoon vinegar <br>
1 teaspoon red chili paste or powder (adjust to your spice preference) <br>
½ teaspoon black pepper powder <br>
Salt to taste <br>
2 tablespoons cornflour <br>
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (maida) <br>
1 egg <br>
Oil for deep frying <br>
Optional for extra crispine: <br>

1-2 tablespoons rice flour 
For the Sauce (Optional): <br>

1 tablespoon cooking oil <br>
1 tablespoon chopped garlic <br>
1 tablespoon finely chopped ginger <br>
2-3 green chilies, slit (adjust to your spice preference) <br>
¼ cup chopped onion <br>
1 tablespoon red chili sauce <br>
1 tablespoon tomato ketchup <br>
1 teaspoon soy sauce <br>
1 teaspoon vinegar <br>
½ teaspoon sugar (optional, to balance flavors) <br>
Salt and pepper to taste <br>
1 tablespoon cornflour mixed with 2 tablespoons water (slurry) <br>
Chopped spring onions and coriander leaves for garnish <br><br>
Instructions <br>
1. Prepare the Chicken Lollipops:<br>

Separate the wings: If using whole chicken wings, cut them at the joint to separate the drumettes (the meatier part resembling a small drumstick) and the wingettes (the flatter part with two bones).
Shape the lollipops (frencheing):
For drumettes: Using a sharp knife, cut around the bone at the thinner end. Push the meat downwards, scraping it off the bone to expose about 1-1.5 inches of the bone. The meat should bunch up at the thicker end, resembling a lollipop.
For wingettes: Locate the two small bones. Cut around the bone closer to the tip. Hold the wingette and twist to loosen the bones. Carefully pull out the smaller of the two bones. Push the meat towards the thicker end, exposing the remaining bone to create a lollipop shape. <br><br>
2. Marinate the Chicken: <br>

In a large bowl, combine the ginger-garlic paste, soy sauce, vinegar, red chili paste or powder, black pepper powder, and salt.
Add the prepared chicken lollipops to the bowl. Mix well to ensure each piece is thoroughly coated with the marinade.
Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2-3 hours for deeper flavor. <br><br>
3. Prepare the Batter: <br>

In a separate bowl, whisk together the cornflour, all-purpose flour (and rice flour, if using, for extra crispiness), and egg.
Add a pinch of salt and pepper to the batter.
Add 2-3 tablespoons of water gradually, mixing until you get a smooth, medium-thick batter that coats the back of a spoon. The consistency should not be too thick or too runny. <br><br>
4. Deep Fry the Chicken:<br>

Heat enough oil in a deep frying pan or wok over medium-high heat for deep frying. The oil should be hot enough but not smoking.
Dip each marinated chicken lollipop into the prepared batter, ensuring it is evenly coated.
Carefully drop the battered lollipops into the hot oil, a few at a time, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Overcrowding will lower the oil temperature and result in less crispy chicken.
Fry the lollipops for 6-8 minutes, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. Turn them occasionally to ensure even cooking.
Remove the fried lollipops with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
Repeat the process with the remaining chicken lollipops. <br><br>
5. Prepare the Sauce (Optional): <br>

Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a separate pan or wok over medium heat.
Add the chopped garlic and ginger, and sauté for a few seconds until fragrant.
Add the slit green chilies and chopped onion. Sauté until the onions are light golden brown.
Add the red chili sauce, tomato ketchup, soy sauce, and vinegar. Stir well.
Add sugar (if using), salt, and pepper to taste. Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer.
Pour in the cornflour slurry (cornflour mixed with water) and stir continuously until the sauce thickens to your desired consistency.
Add the fried chicken lollipops to the sauce and toss gently to coat them evenly.
Garnish with chopped spring onions and coriander leaves. <br><br>
6. Serve: <br>

Serve the chicken lollipops hot on their own or with the prepared sauce. You can also serve them with a side of schezwan sauce, tomato ketchup, or your favorite dipping sauce.
Enjoy your delicious homemade Chicken Lollipops!

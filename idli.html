                Idli Recipe (Steamed Rice Cakes) <br>
Idli are soft and fluffy steamed rice cakes, a staple breakfast food in South India. 
They are light, nutritious, and easy to digest. 
This recipe provides instructions for making traditional white idlis. <br> <br>


Ingredients<br>
2 cups idli rice (also known as parboiled rice or short-grain rice)<br>
½ cup urad dal (split black lentils, skinless) <br>
1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (methi seeds) <br>
Salt to taste <br>
Water, as needed <br>
Oil or ghee, for greasing the idli molds <br> <br>
Instructions<br>
1. Prepare the Batter (Soaking): <br>

Rinse the idli rice and urad dal together thoroughly under running water 2-3 times.
Add the fenugreek seeds to the rice and dal mixture.
Soak them in separate bowls with enough water 
(about 2-3 inches above the grains) for at least 4-6 hours,
  or preferably overnight. Soaking them separately helps in even grinding. <br><br>
2. Grind the Urad Dal:<br>

Drain all the water from the soaked urad dal.
Grind the urad dal in a blender or wet grinder with just enough water to form a very smooth and fluffy batter. The batter should be light and airy. This step is crucial for soft idlis.
Pour the ground urad dal batter into a large, clean, non-reactive bowl. <br><br>
3. Grind the Rice: <br>

Drain all the water from the soaked idli rice and fenugreek seeds.
Grind the rice in the same blender or wet grinder with just enough water to form a slightly coarse batter, similar to semolina (rava) in texture. It should not be as smooth as the urad dal batter.
Add the ground rice batter to the bowl containing the urad dal batter. <br>
4. Mix and Ferment the Batter: <br>

Add salt to taste to the combined batter.
Mix both batters very well with your hand (using your hand helps in good fermentation due to the natural warmth) or a spatula until they are thoroughly combined and the consistency is uniform. The batter should be thick but easily pourable.
Cover the bowl tightly and place it in a warm place to ferment for at least 8-12 hours, 
or until the batter has doubled in volume.
 The fermentation time will vary depending on the temperature of your environment. 
 Given the current time (early May) and location (India), a warm spot in your kitchen should work well. 
The batter should have a slightly sour aroma and a bubbly texture once fermented. <br><br>
5. Prepare the Idli Steamer and Molds: <br>

Grease the idli molds with a little oil or ghee to prevent the idlis from sticking.
Fill the idli steamer or a large pot with about 1-2 inches of water and bring it to a boil. If using a pot, you'll need a stand to place the idli plates above the water level and a tight-fitting lid. <br><br>
6. Steam the Idlis: <br>

Once the batter has fermented, gently stir it without deflating too much of the air. If the batter is too thick, you can add a tablespoon or two of water to adjust the consistency.
Pour the batter into the greased idli molds, filling them about ¾ full.
Carefully place the filled idli plates into the steamer.
Cover the steamer tightly with a lid and steam on medium heat for 15-20 minutes, 
or until the idlis are cooked through. To check if they are done, 
insert a toothpick or a knife into an idli; it should come out clean. <br><br>
7. Unmold the Idlis: <br>

Turn off the heat and let the steamer stand for a couple of minutes. This helps the idlis set properly.
Carefully remove the idli plates from the steamer.
Moisten a spoon or a knife with water and gently scoop out the idlis from the molds. <br><br>
8. Serve: <br>

Serve the hot and fluffy idlis with sambar, coconut chutney, tomato chutney, or any other chutney of your choice.
Enjoy your delicious homemade Idlis!

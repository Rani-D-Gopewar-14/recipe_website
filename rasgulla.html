                    Rasgulla Recipe (Spongy Milk Balls in Sugar Syrup) <br>
Rasgulla is a popular Bengali dessert made from fresh cheese curds (chenna)
 that are kneaded into smooth balls, cooked in a light sugar syrup, and 
 become incredibly spongy and juicy. <br><br>


Ingredients
For the Chenna (Fresh Cheese Curds): <br>

1 liter full-fat milk <br>
2-3 tablespoons lemon juice or white vinegar <br>
For the Sugar Syrup: <br>

2 cups sugar <br>
4 cups water <br>
2-3 green cardamom pods, lightly crushed (optional) <br>
1 teaspoon rose water (optional) <br> <br>
Instructions <br>
1. Make the Chenna (Fresh Cheese Curds): <br>

Pour the milk into a heavy-bottomed pan and bring it to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking.1 Â  
<br>

Once the milk starts boiling, reduce the heat to low and gradually add the lemon juice or white vinegar, a tablespoon at a time, stirring gently. The milk will start to curdle, and you will see the whey (light greenish liquid) separating from the solids (chenna).
Once the whey is clear and the chenna has completely separated, turn off the heat. Be careful not to over-curdle the milk, as this will result in hard chenna.
Line a clean muslin cloth or cheesecloth over a strainer placed over a bowl.
Pour the curdled milk mixture into the cloth-lined strainer.
Rinse the chenna under cold running water for a few minutes to remove any traces of lemon juice or vinegar. This step is crucial to ensure the rasgullas don't taste sour.
Gather the edges of the muslin cloth and squeeze out as much whey as possible.
Hang the cloth containing the chenna for about 30-45 minutes to drain the excess water. 
The chenna should be moist but not wet. If it's too dry, the rasgullas will be hard; if it's too wet, they might break while cooking. <br>
2. Knead the Chenna: <br>

Open the muslin cloth and transfer the drained chenna onto a clean, flat surface (like a plate or a clean countertop).
Mash the chenna well with the heel of your palm for 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth, soft, and dough-like. There should be no grainy texture. This step is very important for achieving soft and spongy rasgullas. 
The chenna should bind together easily without any cracks. <br><br>
3. Shape the Rasgullas: <br>

Divide the kneaded chenna into small, equal portions (about 1 inch in diameter).
Gently roll each portion between your palms to form smooth, round, crack-free balls. Make sure there are no cracks on the surface, as these can cause the rasgullas to break apart in the syrup. <br><br>
4. Prepare the Sugar Syrup: <br>

In a separate wide and deep pan or pressure cooker, combine the sugar and water.
Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved.
Once the sugar syrup starts boiling, reduce the heat to medium. If using, add the lightly crushed green cardamom pods. <br><br>
5. Cook the Rasgullas in Sugar Syrup: <br>

Gently drop the prepared chenna balls one by one into the simmering sugar syrup. Make sure not to overcrowd the pan.
Increase the heat to medium-high and let the syrup come to a rolling boil again.
Cover the pan tightly with a lid. This is crucial for the rasgullas to cook properly and become spongy.
Cook for 15-20 minutes. Do not open the lid during this time. The steam trapped inside helps the rasgullas swell up.
After 15-20 minutes, gently open the lid. The rasgullas should have doubled in size and look light and spongy.
If you are using a pressure cooker, after the syrup boils and you add the rasgullas, close the lid and cook for 1 whistle on medium heat. Let the pressure release naturally. <br><br>
6. Add Flavorings and Cool: <br>

Gently stir in the rose water (if using).
Turn off the heat and let the rasgullas cool down completely in the sugar syrup. This allows them to absorb the syrup and become even more juicy. <br><br>
7. Chill and Serve:
<br>
Once cooled, transfer the rasgullas along with the syrup to a serving bowl.
Refrigerate for at least 2-3 hours before serving. Chilled rasgullas taste best.
Enjoy these incredibly soft, spongy, and sweet Rasgullas! They are a true delight.

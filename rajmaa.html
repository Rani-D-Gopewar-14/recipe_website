        <h1>Rajmaa</h1>  <br>

        <p class="paragraph">

            Ingredients: <br>

Kidney Beans: 1 cup dried red kidney beans <br>
Onion: 1 medium, finely chopped <br>
Tomatoes: 2 medium, finely chopped or 1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes <br>
Ginger-Garlic Paste: 1 tablespoon (or 1 inch ginger and 4-5 cloves garlic, crushed) <br> 
Green Chilies: 1-2, slit lengthwise (adjust to your spice preference) <br>
Turmeric Powder: ½ teaspoon <br>
Red Chili Powder: 1 teaspoon (adjust to your spice preference) <br>
Coriander Powder: 2 teaspoons <br>
Cumin Powder: 1 teaspoon <br>
Garam Masala: 1 teaspoon <br>
Dried Fenugreek Leaves (Kasuri Methi): 1 teaspoon, crushed <br>
Cooking Oil: 2-3 tablespoons (vegetable oil, mustard oil, or ghee) <br>
Cumin Seeds: 1 teaspoon <br>
Asafoetida (Hing): A pinch (optional) <br>
Fresh Cilantro: 2 tablespoons, finely chopped, for garnish <br>
Salt: To taste <br>
Water: As needed <br>
Instructions: <br><br>

Soak the Kidney Beans: Wash the dried kidney beans thoroughly and soak them in plenty of water overnight (at least 8 hours) or for 4-6 hours in hot water. Drain the soaked beans.
Pressure Cook the Beans (Recommended): Transfer the soaked and drained beans to a pressure cooker. Add 3-4 cups of fresh water and salt to taste. Close the lid and cook on medium-high heat for 4-5 whistles, or until the beans are completely soft and easily mashed. Let the pressure release naturally.
Cook the Beans in a Pot (Alternative): If you don't have a pressure cooker, you can cook the soaked beans in a large pot with enough water to cover them by about 2 inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 1.5 - 2 hours, or until the beans are very tender. You may need to add more water during cooking to keep the beans submerged. Add salt during the last 30 minutes of cooking.
Prepare the Base: While the beans are cooking, heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pot or pan over medium heat.
Temper the Spices: Once the oil is hot, add cumin seeds and asafoetida (if using). Let the cumin seeds splutter.
Sauté Aromatics: Add the chopped onion and sauté until golden brown. This should take about 5-7 minutes.
Add Ginger-Garlic and Green Chilies: Stir in the ginger-garlic paste and slit green chilies. Sauté for another minute until the raw smell disappears.
Cook Tomatoes and Spices: Add the chopped tomatoes (or canned diced tomatoes) along with turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and cumin powder. Cook the mixture on medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes soften and the oil starts to separate from the sides. This usually takes about 5-7 minutes.
Mash Some Beans (Optional): Once the pressure from the cooker has released, open the lid and lightly mash a few tablespoons of the cooked kidney beans with the back of a spoon. This helps to thicken the gravy.
Combine Beans and Base: Add the cooked kidney beans (along with the cooking liquid) to the tomato-onion base. Stir well to combine.
Simmer and Thicken: Bring the rajma to a gentle simmer. Add garam masala and crushed kasuri methi. Adjust the consistency of the gravy by adding more water if needed. Simmer for another 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
Garnish and Serve: Check the salt and adjust if necessary. Garnish with fresh cilantro. Serve hot with rice, roti, naan, or paratha.
Enjoy your homemade Rajma!

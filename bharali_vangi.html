            Bharli Wangi (Maharashtrian Stuffed Eggplant) <br>
            This is a flavorful and popular Maharashtrian dish where small 
            eggplants are stuffed with a spicy and nutty mixture and then cooked in a savory gravy. <br>
            
        
            
            Ingredients: <br>
            
            For the Stuffing: <br>
            
            1/2 cup roasted peanuts, skinned <br>
            2 tablespoons sesame seeds <br>
            3 tablespoons desiccated coconut (dry coconut) <br>
            1 medium onion, finely chopped <br>
            3-4 cloves garlic, roughly chopped <br>
            1-inch ginger, roughly chopped <br>
            1/4 cup chopped fresh coriander leaves <br>
            1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to your spice preference) <br>
            1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder <br>
            1 tablespoon Goda Masala (Maharashtrian spice blend) or Garam Masala <br>
            1/2 teaspoon cumin powder <br>
            1/4 teaspoon asafoetida (hing) <br>
            1 small piece of tamarind or 1 teaspoon tamarind paste <br>
            Salt to taste <br><br>
            For the Eggplants: <br>
            
            8-10 small purple eggplants (brinjals) <br>
            2 tablespoons oil <br>
            1 teaspoon mustard seeds <br>
            1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds <br>
            A pinch of asafoetida (hing) <br>
            1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder <br>
            1/2 teaspoon red chili powder1 (optional)    <br>
            1 medium tomato, finely chopped <br>
            1 cup water (or as needed for gravy) <br>
            1/2 teaspoon jaggery (optional, for a hint of sweetness) <br>
            2 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander leaves, for garnish <br>
            Instructions: <br><br>
            
            1. Prepare the Eggplants: <br>
            
            Wash the eggplants thoroughly. Trim off the very top of the stem, leaving a little bit attached.
            Make two vertical slits in each eggplant from the bottom up towards the stem, ensuring the stem remains intact so the eggplant stays whole. This creates four pockets for stuffing.
            Soak the slit eggplants in salted water for about 15-20 minutes to prevent discoloration and remove any bitterness. Drain them well before stuffing.
            2. Make the Stuffing: <br> <br>
            
            Roast the dry ingredients: In a dry pan, roast the peanuts on low heat until they are lightly browned and crunchy. Let them cool slightly, then rub off the skins.
            In the same pan, roast the sesame seeds until they start to splutter and turn light golden brown.
            Add the desiccated coconut to the pan and roast until it turns light golden brown. Be careful not to burn it.
            Let all the roasted ingredients cool down completely.
            Grind the stuffing: In a grinder or blender, combine the roasted peanuts, sesame seeds, and desiccated coconut. Grind them to a coarse powder.
            Add the chopped onion, garlic, ginger, coriander leaves, red chili powder, turmeric powder, Goda Masala (or Garam Masala), cumin powder, asafoetida, tamarind (or tamarind paste), and salt to the ground mixture.
            Grind again to form a slightly coarse paste. You can add 1-2 teaspoons of water if needed to help the blending, but the mixture should be thick.
            3. Stuff the Eggplants: <br><br>
            
            Gently open the slits of each eggplant and stuff them generously with the prepared masala paste. Press the stuffing in firmly.
            If there is any leftover stuffing, set it aside. It will be used in the gravy.
            4. Cook the Bharli Wangi: <br><br>
            
            Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pan or a kadai (wok) over medium heat.
            Once the oil is hot, add mustard seeds. Let them splutter.
            Add cumin seeds and asafoetida. Sauté for a few seconds.
            Add turmeric powder and the optional red chili powder. Sauté briefly.
            Add the finely chopped tomato and sauté until it softens and the oil starts to separate from the sides.
            Add the leftover stuffing (if any) to the pan and sauté for 1-2 minutes.
            Gently place the stuffed eggplants in the pan. Sauté them for 2-3 minutes, turning them carefully so they are coated with the masala.
            Pour in the water and add the jaggery (if using) and salt to taste. Mix gently.
            Cover the pan and cook on low to medium heat for 20-25 minutes, or until the eggplants are tender and cooked through. Check occasionally and add more water if the gravy becomes too thick.
            Once the eggplants are cooked and the gravy has reached your desired consistency, garnish with fresh coriander leaves.
            5. Serve: <br><br>
            
            Serve Bharli Wangi hot with roti, chapati, bhakri, or as a side dish with rice and dal.
            Enjoy this delicious and authentic Maharashtrian Bharli Wangi!

        Sambar Vada Recipe <br>
Sambar Vada is a popular South Indian dish consisting of crispy lentil 
fritters (vadas) soaked in a flavorful lentil and vegetable stew (sambar). 
Here's a recipe for making both at home: <br>



Ingredients 
For the Vadas:<br>

1 cup urad dal (split black lentils without skin) <br>
¼ cup chana dal (split chickpeas) <br>
2-3 green chilies, finely chopped (adjust to your spice preference) <br>
1 inch ginger, grated <br>
1 sprig curry leaves, finely chopped <br>
2 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander leaves <br>
Salt to taste <br>
Oil for deep frying <br>
For the Sambar: <br>

½ cup toor dal (split pigeon peas) <br>
1 cup mixed vegetables, chopped (e.g., drumsticks, carrots, eggplant, okra, pumpkin, beans) <br>
1 small onion, chopped <br>
1 tomato, chopped <br>
1 teaspoon turmeric powder <br>
1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to your spice preference) <br>
1 teaspoon coriander powder1    <br>

½ teaspoon cumin powder <br>
1 tablespoon sambar powder (store-bought or homemade) <br>
1 small ball of tamarind pulp (about 1 inch), soaked in ½ cup warm water and extract the juice
1-2 teaspoons jaggery (optional, to balance the tanginess)<br>
Salt to taste <br>
2 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander leaves, for garnish<br><br>
For Tempering (Tadka): <br>

2 tablespoons oil or ghee <br>
1 teaspoon mustard seeds <br>
½ teaspoon fenugreek seeds <br>
2-3 dry red chilies, broken into pieces <br>
1 sprig curry leaves<br>
A pinch of asafoetida (hing) <br><br>
Instructions <br>
1. Prepare the Vada Batter: <br>

Rinse the urad dal and chana dal thoroughly under cold water.
Soak the dals together in enough water for at least 4-5 hours, or preferably overnight.
Drain all the water from the soaked dals.
Grind the soaked dals in a grinder or blender with minimal water to a thick, fluffy, and smooth batter. The batter should be thick enough to hold its shape when dropped.
Transfer the batter to a bowl. Add the finely chopped green chilies, grated ginger, chopped curry leaves, chopped coriander leaves, and salt to taste.
Mix everything well. Beat the batter with your hand for 2-3 minutes in a circular motion. This incorporates air and makes the vadas light and fluffy. <br><br>
2. Prepare the Sambar:<br>

Rinse the toor dal thoroughly under cold water.
In a pressure cooker or a pot, add the toor dal, chopped mixed vegetables, chopped onion, chopped tomato, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and cumin powder.
Add about 2-3 cups of water (adjust based on the desired consistency of the sambar).
Pressure cook for 3-4 whistles on medium heat, or until the dal and vegetables are cooked and mushy. If cooking in a pot, simmer until the dal and vegetables are tender.
Once cooked, mash the dal and vegetables lightly with a ladle or a masher.
Add the tamarind extract and sambar powder to the mashed dal and vegetables. Mix well.
Add jaggery (if using) and salt to taste.
Bring the sambar to a simmer and cook for another 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, so that the flavors meld together. Add more water if the sambar becomes too thick. <br><br>
3. Prepare the Tempering (Tadka) for Sambar: <br>

Heat oil or ghee in a small pan over medium heat.
Add mustard seeds and let them splutter.
Add fenugreek seeds and dry red chilies. Fry for a few seconds.
Add curry leaves and asafoetida. Fry for a few more seconds until the curry leaves are crisp.
Pour the tempering into the simmering sambar.
Garnish the sambar with chopped fresh coriander leaves. Keep the sambar warm. <b<br>r>
4. Fry the Vadas: <br>

Heat enough oil in a deep frying pan or kadai over medium heat. The oil should be hot enough but not smoking.
Wet your fingers slightly. Take a small portion of the vada batter (about 2 tablespoons). Shape it into a round disc and make a hole in the center with your thumb.
Gently slide the shaped vada into the hot oil. Fry a few vadas at a time, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan.
Fry the vadas on medium heat until they are golden brown and crispy on all sides. Flip them occasionally for even cooking.
Remove the fried vadas with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
Repeat the process with the remaining batter. <br><br>
5. Assemble and Serve: <br>

Once the vadas are fried and the sambar is ready, you have two ways to serve Sambar Vada: <br>

Soaked Vadas: Gently drop the hot or warm vadas into the warm sambar. Let them soak for 5-10 minutes so they absorb the flavors and become soft but still hold their shape.
Served Separately: Serve the crispy vadas in a bowl and pour the hot sambar over them just before serving.
Garnish with more fresh coriander leaves if desired. <br><br>

Serve Sambar Vada hot as a breakfast, snack, or light meal. It is often accompanied by coconut chutney.

Enjoy your delicious homemade Sambar Vada!
